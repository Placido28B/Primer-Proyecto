1- What is a programming language?

A programming language is a computer language specially designed to describe the set of consecutive actions or instructions that a computer must execute.

2- How is different interpreted languages from compiled ones?

In general, the difference between compiled and interpreted languages ​​is that the former use a compiler to be able to translate it and execute the program, while the latter require an interpreter to translate the code at execution time.

3- 3 basic reasons:

First: purposes evolve faster than programming languages. By the time design of a language has progressed, additional needs have arisen that simply do not have time to incorporate into the language specification.

Second: one does not always want to solve life for others. On many occasions it is desired to solve a specific problem by creating a programming language. This approach makes the idea of ​​creating a language that solves all problems meaningless.

Third: programming languages ​​are products of their respective committees, research centers or companies... and a dynamic of competition is generated around them.
